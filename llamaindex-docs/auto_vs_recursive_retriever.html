<h1>Comparing Methods for Structured Retrieval (Auto-Retrieval vs. Recursive Retrieval)<a class="headerlink" href="#comparing-methods-for-structured-retrieval-auto-retrieval-vs-recursive-retrieval" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>In a naive RAG system, the set of input documents are then chunked, embedded, and dumped to a vector database collection. Retrieval would just fetch the top-k documents by embedding similarity.</p>
<p>This can fail if the set of documents is large - it can be hard to disambiguate raw chunks, and you’re not guaranteed to filter for the set of documents that contain relevant context.</p>
<p>In this guide we explore <strong>structured retrieval</strong> - more advanced query algorithms that take advantage of structure within your documents for higher-precision retrieval. We compare the following two methods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval</strong>: Tag each document with the right set of metadata. During query-time, use auto-retrieval to infer metadata filters along with passing through the query string for semantic search.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Store Document Hierarchies (summaries -&gt; raw chunks) + Recursive Retrieval</strong>: Embed document summaries and map that to the set of raw chunks for each document. During query-time, do recursive retrieval to first fetch summaries before fetching documents.</p></li>
</ul>

The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film Space Jam, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former&#39;s first retirement from basketball.They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson&#39;s &quot;Jam&quot; (1992).Since 2008, Jordan&#39;s yearly income from the endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.In addition, when Jordan&#39;s power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.An academic study found that Jordan&#39;s first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.Most of Jordan&#39;s endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.Jordan has described Falk as &quot;the best at what he does&quot; and that &quot;marketing-wise, he&#39;s great.He&#39;s the one who came up with the concept of &#39;Air Jordan&#39;.&quot;
Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as &quot;the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists.&quot;In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.After briefly filing for divorce in 2014, Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017; he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.Johnny Depp later accused Musk of having an affair with Heard while she was still married to Depp.Musk and Heard both denied the affair.In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.According to Musk and Grimes, his name was &quot;X Æ A-12&quot; (); however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet, and was then changed to &quot;X Æ A-Xii&quot;.This drew more confusion, as Æ is not a letter in the modern English alphabet.
=== Film and television ===
Jordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam.The film received mixed reviews, but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.In 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled Michael Jordan to the Max.Two decades later, the same period of Jordan&#39;s life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020.The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan&#39;s and his teammates&#39; off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary.The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.
He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir &quot;there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private&quot;.Jordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single &quot;Franchise&quot; at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries The Captain, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.


=== Books ===
Jordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.

Rare Air: Michael on Michael, with Mark Vancil and Walter Iooss (Harper San Francisco, 1993).
I Can&#39;t Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence, with Mark Vancil and Sandro Miller (Harper San Francisco, 1994).
For the Love of the Game: My Story, with Mark Vancil (Crown Publishers, 1998).
Driven from Within, with Mark Vancil (Atria Books, 2005).
&quot;In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s sex trafficking operation.In May, a judge granted the U.S. Virgin Islands&#39; request to serve Musk electronically through Tesla after the U.S. territory had difficulty locating him.The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.


== Public perception ==

Though Musk&#39;s ventures were influential within their own industries in the 2000s, he only became a public figure in the early 2010s.He has often been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses.Celebrated by fans and hated by critics, Musk was described by Vance as having become very polarizing because of his &quot;part philosopher, part troll&quot; role on Twitter.With Steve Jobs and Donald Trump, Musk served as inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).Musk had a cameo appearance in the film&#39;s 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.
Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.Jordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.


== Media figure and business interests ==


=== Endorsements ===
Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history.He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald&#39;s, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.
=== Business ventures ===
In June 2010, Jordan was ranked by Forbes as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010.According to Forbes, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal&#39;s Business Person of the Year for 2014.In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.Forbes designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan&#39;s 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.As of 2023, his net worth is estimated at $2 billion by Forbes, making him the fifth-richest African-American, behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, and Rihanna.Jordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name.
He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at Stanford University.However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.


== Business career ==
He starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film Space Jam (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series The Last Dance (2020).He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023, and he is also the owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series.In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.That year, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.As of 2023, his net worth is estimated at $2 billion.


== Early life ==
Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York City&#39;s Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963, to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.
The New York Post revealed that Musk&#39;s ex-wife Talulah Riley had encouraged Musk to purchase Twitter, specifically citing the Bee&#39;s ban.Following the acquisition, he made reinstatement of accounts like the Bee an immediate priority.The Independent reported that Musk has &quot;appealed to far-right activists and influencers and unleashed a wave of hate speech and abuse aimed at LGBT+ people&quot; since taking control of Twitter.On December 18, Musk posted a poll to his Twitter account asking users to decide whether he should step down as the head of Twitter, with 57.5% out of the more than 17.5 million votes supporting that decision.Musk then announced that he would resign as CEO &quot;as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job&quot;.On May 11, 2023, Musk announced that he would be stepping down from the CEO position and instead moving to &quot;exec chair &amp; CTO, overseeing product, software &amp; sysops&quot; and announced the new CEO, former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino.
Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013), Why Him?(2016), and Men in Black: International (2019).Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (&quot;The Musk Who Fell to Earth&quot;, 2015), The Big Bang Theory (&quot;The Platonic Permutation&quot;, 2015), South Park (&quot;Members Only&quot;, 2016), Young Sheldon (&quot;A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®&quot;, 2017), Rick and Morty (&quot;One Crew over the Crewcoo&#39;s Morty&quot;, 2019), and Saturday Night Live (2021).He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University and IEEE Honorary Membership.
In March 2019, Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk &quot;had no conception of what the cave passage was like&quot; and &quot;can stick his submarine where it hurts&quot;.Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a &quot;pedo guy&quot;.He deleted the tweets, and apologized, and he deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a &quot;child rapist&quot; and said that he had married a child.In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in the District Court for the Central District of California.

=== Music ===
In 2019, Musk, through Emo G Records, released a rap track, &quot;RIP Harambe&quot;, on SoundCloud. The track, which refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event, was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop. The following year, Musk released an EDM track, &quot;Don&#39;t Doubt Ur Vibe&quot;, featuring his own lyrics and vocals. While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as &quot;indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on Soundcloud&quot;, TechCrunch said it was &quot;not a bad representation of the genre&quot;.
Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.Musk denied the report.


=== Legal matters ===

In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016.The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.Musk responded, &quot;If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light&quot;.He accused the article from Business Insider of being a &quot;politically motivated hit piece&quot;.After the release of the Business Insider article, Tesla&#39;s stock fell by more than 6%, decreasing Musk&#39;s net worth by $10 billion.Barron&#39;s wrote &quot;...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.

They had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a daughter, Jasmine.The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter.They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made &quot;mutually and amicably&quot;.It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $244 million in 2022), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.In 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion.It was completed in 1995.He listed the mansion for sale in 2012.He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.On July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.

Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also  known by his initials MJ, is an American former professional basketball player and businessman.The official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states: &quot;By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.&quot;He played fifteen seasons in the NBA, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls.He was integral in popularizing the sport of basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon.Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels.As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels&#39; national championship team in 1982.Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game&#39;s best defensive players.His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames &quot;Air Jordan&quot; and &quot;His Airness&quot;.Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat.
== Personal life ==
From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded. In 2020, he relocated to Texas, saying that California had become &quot;complacent&quot; about its economic success. While hosting Saturday Night Live in May 2021, Musk revealed that he has Asperger syndrome. Musk is also a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.


=== Relationships and children ===
Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen&#39;s University in Ontario, Canada; and they married in 2000.In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.After his death, the couple decided to use IVF to continue their family.They had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.In 2022, one of the twins officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity as a trans woman, and to use Wilson as her last name because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.
In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication&#39;s 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.Jordan&#39;s athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up.In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players &quot;the next Michael Jordan&quot; upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.Some analysts, such as The Ringer&#39;s Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan&#39;s experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it &quot;inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game&#39;s stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers&quot;, such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.Don Nelson stated: &quot;I would&#39;ve been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.
In his defense, Musk argued that &quot;&#39;pedo guy&#39; was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with &#39;creepy old man&#39; and is used to insult a person&#39;s appearance and demeanor&quot;.The defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet.On December 6, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.
Elon Reeve Musk ( EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor.Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX;  angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation.He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$217 billion as of August 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $219 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.Two years later, he matriculated at Queen&#39;s University in Kingston, Ontario.Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor&#39;s degrees in economics and physics there.He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University.
He also endorsed Kanye West&#39;s 2020 presidential campaign.He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.In 2022, Musk said that he could &quot;no longer support&quot; the Democrats because they are the &quot;party of division &amp; hate&quot;, and wrote a tweet encouraging &quot;independent-minded voters&quot; to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections, which was an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy.He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and Twitter hosted DeSantis&#39;s campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event As of May 2023, Musk was declining to endorse any specific candidate.Musk opposes a &quot;billionaire&#39;s tax&quot;, and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren.He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase &quot;Hands up, don&#39;t shoot&quot; was made up.
Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 and suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, after which the phrase &quot;Space Karen&quot; trended on Twitter, in reference to Musk.However, in December 2021, Musk revealed that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine.


=== Finance ===
Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to discourage poor behavior.The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.In addition, Tesla made large sums from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits offered in California and at the United States federal level, which facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles, as the tax credits given by governments enabled Tesla&#39;s battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive, in comparison with existing lower-priced internal combustion engine vehicles.
== Personal views and Twitter (later X) usage ==

Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009, Musk has been an active user and has over 100 million followers as of June 2022. He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues. Musk&#39;s statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns, and comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler. The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as &quot;chaotic&quot;, and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests. As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia&#39;s apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop. Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance. The Israel government and several media outlets accused Musk of antisemitism due to him spreading George Soros conspiracy theories, although some Israeli officials defended Musk.


=== Existential threats ===
Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.
=== Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case ===

In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.Engineers at SpaceX and the Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.By this time, however, eight of the 12 children, had already been rescued, the rescuers employing full face masks, oxygen, and anesthesia; consequently, Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.
==== First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995) ====

On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball.Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus bearing the license plate &quot;UNC 0023&quot;.His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.Green and Demery were found after they made calls on James Jordan&#39;s cell phone, convicted at a trial, and sentenced to life in prison.Jordan was close to his father; as a child, he imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work.He later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.In 1996, he founded a Chicago-area Boys &amp; Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.
The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with &quot;X&quot; as a first name, &quot;AE A-XII&quot; as a middle name, and &quot;Musk&quot; as surname.In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed &quot;Y&quot;), born via surrogacy.Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were &quot;semi-separated&quot; in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: &quot;I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we&#39;re very fluid.&quot;Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again but remained on good terms.In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December.The news &quot;raise[d] questions about workplace ethics&quot;, given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.
The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990, and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan&#39;s.Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City&#39;s Grand Central Terminal, among others; that restaurant closed in 2018.Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII, under construction in Hobe Sound, Florida.In September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.


=== Philanthropy ===
From 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago&#39;s Hales Franciscan High School.The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.The Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.
After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack.In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan&#39;s former coaches, were also among those present.His emotional reaction during his speech when he began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the &quot;Crying Jordan&quot; Internet meme.In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.In October 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.In September 2022, Jordan&#39;s jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.
Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010, and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions in 2010, 2013, 2018, and 2021.Musk was selected as Time&#39;s &quot;Person of the Year&quot; for 2021.Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that &quot;Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too&quot;.In February 2022, Musk was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.Musk&#39;s family was wealthy during his youth.His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father&#39;s dislike of apartheid.His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.Maye Musk has said of her son that he &quot;was shy and awkward at school&quot; and &quot;didn&#39;t have many friends&quot;.
He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).In 1999, he was named the 20th century&#39;s greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press&#39; list of athletes of the century.Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men&#39;s Olympic basketball team (&quot;The Dream Team&quot;).He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a &quot;Dream Team&quot; member in 2017.In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan is known for his product endorsements.He fueled the success of Nike&#39;s Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.
This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.Tesla&#39;s stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal, causing Musk to lose around $30 billion of his net worth.He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde&#39;s policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was &quot;on hold&quot; following a report that 5% of Twitter&#39;s daily active users were spam accounts, causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition, he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter&#39;s Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.
Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals.The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago&#39;s leader.He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.


==== Gambling ====
During the Bulls&#39; 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.
The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan&#39;s 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, but the rumor spread widely.In 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that he made reckless decisions.Jordan stated: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I&#39;ve pushed the envelope.Is that compulsive?Yeah, it depends on how you look at it.If you&#39;re willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.&quot;When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: &quot;No.&quot;In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of Jordan Rides the Bus, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research &quot;convinced [him it] was nonsense&quot;.
The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between &quot;Air&quot; Jordan and Clyde &quot;The Glide&quot; during the pre-Finals hype.In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside.Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this.&quot;The Bulls went on to win Game 1 and defeat the Blazers in six games.Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.In the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting, Jordan&#39;s streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley, which upset him.
While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX&#39;s rocket, vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla&#39;s software.Musk&#39;s handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as &quot;carrot and stick&quot;, rewarding those &quot;who offer constructive criticism&quot; while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week.He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees, such as during the Model 3 &quot;production hell&quot; in 2018.In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla&#39;s workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.Musk&#39;s leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors, and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as &quot;show[ing] a lack of human understanding.&quot;The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.
As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald&#39;s All-American Game and scored 30 points, after averaging 27 ppg, 12 rebounds (rpg), and six assists per game (apg) for the season.He was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.
=== 2018 Joe Rogan podcast appearance ===
In 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. During the interview, Musk sampled a puff from a cigar consisting, the host claimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of Tesla&#39;s vice president of worldwide finance earlier that day. Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air Force, though an Air Force spokesperson told The Verge that there was no investigation and that the Air Force was still determining the facts. In 2022, Musk claimed that he and other Space-X employees were subjected to random drug tests for about a year following the incident. In a 60 Minutes interview, Musk said of the incident: &quot;I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.&quot;
=== Private jet ===

In 2003, Musk said his favorite plane he owned was an L-39 Albatros. He uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020. His heavy use of the jet—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.His flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. The Twitter version of the account was blocked in December 2022, after Musk claimed that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed. This led to Musk banning the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O&#39;Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept. Musk equated the reporting to doxxing. The police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker. Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists&#39; accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.
&quot;Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his &quot;Air Jordan&quot; image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: &quot;I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan.Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking.That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.&quot;During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.In August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 &quot;Dream Team&quot;; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan&#39;s short career in the Minor League Baseball.
Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men&#39;s basketball teams).Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger, Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.Many of Jordan&#39;s contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.Jordan placed second to Ruth in the Associated Press&#39; December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.
James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army&#39;s XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football.He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level.His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney&#39;s junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.

He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.In March 2020, Musk stated, &quot;The coronavirus panic is dumb.&quot;In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a &quot;specific form of the common cold&quot; and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be &quot;probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April&quot;.Politico labeled this statement one of &quot;the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]&quot;.Musk also claimed falsely that children &quot;are essentially immune&quot; to COVID-19.Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.
Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.Since its initial public offering in 2010, Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020, and it entered the S&amp;P 500 later that year.In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since &quot;much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance&quot;.After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week, and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.
During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting, and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders.He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described him as &quot;the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls&quot; in November, and Jordan appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; in December.The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.This led to a so-called &quot;freeze-out&quot; on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game.The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.
The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal; Musk became the CEO instead.He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a &quot;blue check&quot;, and laid off a significant portion of the company&#39;s staff.Musk lessened content moderation, and in December, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter&#39;s moderation of Hunter Biden&#39;s laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists, and a study of millions of tweets following the acquisition indicated that hate speech on the platform has become &quot;more visible&quot; under Musk&#39;s leadership.Within the first weeks of ownership, Musk made a series of decisions and changes that he quickly reversed, including the paid blue checkmark, creating an &quot;official&quot; label and forbidding linking to one&#39;s profiles on other social media platforms.Under Musk&#39;s management, Twitter experienced several large scale outages.In April 2022, The Washington Post reported that Musk privately claimed that supposed censorship on the platform, including the banning of accounts such as The Babylon Bee, had prompted him to begin the acquisition.
Musk also promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.: 207–208  In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China.His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a &quot;special administrative zone&quot; of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and &quot;peace plan&quot; to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine.It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.


=== COVID-19 ===
Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the &quot;Be Like Mike&quot; commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.One of Jordan&#39;s more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon.In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan&#39;s abilities and became convinced that &quot;it&#39;s gotta be the shoes&quot;.The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of &quot;shoe-jackings&quot;, in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint.Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the &quot;Jordan Brand&quot;.The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.Jordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters.A Nike commercial shown during 1992&#39;s Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.
Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.He has warned of a &quot;Terminator-like&quot; AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.Musk&#39;s AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI, and has advocated for a carbon tax.Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump&#39;s stance on climate change, and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump&#39;s 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a &quot;multiplanetary species&quot;.He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.
In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion and subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year.In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including that of spreading COVID-19 misinformation, and promoting conspiracy theories.His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including letting off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the platform and features such as Twitter Blue and the implementation of limits on the amount of viewable Tweets per day being criticized.In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla.To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.


== Early life ==


=== Childhood and family ===

Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of South Africa&#39;s capital cities.Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.
Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.During the course of his professional career, he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.Jordan&#39;s individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.
In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order, and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk&#39;s offer, Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were &quot;not at risk for COVID&quot;.
Broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan&#39;s dominance to Shaquille O&#39;Neal, stating: &quot;Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.&quot;


== Legacy ==
Jordan&#39;s talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he was being compared to Julius Erving.Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan was the best player he ever saw, and that he was &quot;one of a kind&quot;, and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete.In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a near minute-long standing ovation.After establishing the single game playoff record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described him as &quot;God disguised as Michael Jordan&quot;.Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain&#39;s record of seven consecutive scoring titles.

Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017, and had previously questioned the platform&#39;s commitment to freedom of speech.In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April, making him the largest shareholder.When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company&#39;s 2013 IPO.On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter&#39;s board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter&#39;s stock at $54.20 per share.In response, Twitter&#39;s board adopted a &quot;poison pill&quot; shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.
In his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.The added exhaustion due to the &quot;Dream Team&quot; run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan&#39;s feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status.Jordan&#39;s announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.Jordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team&#39;s minor league system on March 31, 1994.Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan&#39;s basketball contract during the years he played baseball.In 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.
As of 2019, he has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.In 2023, Jordan donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.In 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.In 2018, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas&#39; recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.On June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to &quot;ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education&quot;.In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.
Jordan was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, winning all 30 games he took part in.


== Player profile ==
Jordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards, and as a point guard.Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer.With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances.Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as &quot;a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone&#39;s weakest spot&quot;.As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not &quot;tough enough&quot; to compete with him in practice.To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents.
== National team career ==
Jordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela.He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal in the competition.A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics.The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale.Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.In 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.The team went on to win two gold medals: the first one in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, and the second one in the 1992 Summer Olympics.He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.
In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.


==== Starlink ====

In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access, with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018.A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself &quot;a free speech absolutist&quot;.
During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago&#39;s point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who would put Jordan at point guard.In his time as a point guard, Jordan averaged 10 triple-doubles in eleven games, with 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record, and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit &quot;The Shot&quot; over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.
On June 20, 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, suggesting that he might be interested in investing in India &quot;as soon as humanly possible&quot;.


==== SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets ====
In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC&#39;s allegations.As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.In April 2022, the shareholder who sued Musk over the tweet, along with several Tesla shareholders, said that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although the ruling in question has not been unsealed.
At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.At age twelve, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.


=== Education ===
Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from where he graduated.Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother, knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.In 1990, he entered Queen&#39;s University in Kingston, Ontario.Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School.Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, UPenn maintains it awarded them in 1997.

He was also a fixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant).Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 ppg, respectively.By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer.In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls&#39; primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.Jordan&#39;s total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.He scored 32,292 points in the regular season, placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.With five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history.
His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead.His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.On November 1, 1994, his No.23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit outside the new United Center.


==== &quot;I&#39;m back&quot;: Return to the NBA (1995) ====
The Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier.Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March; the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.
Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant) Mike Griffin later that year.After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform.Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk&#39;s personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.Since 2019, SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.
At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both; in the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia.After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56.Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting &quot;We want Mike!&quot;After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining.At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers&#39; Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws.After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench.Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.
==== SolarCity and Tesla Energy ====

Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006. By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal&#39;s announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla&#39;s stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla&#39;s directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders. Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. Two years later, the court ruled in Musk&#39;s favor.
In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan&#39;s honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season.The &quot;Michael Jordan Trophy&quot; will replace the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff, with a new Podoloff Trophy set to be awarded to the team with the best overall regular season record.

Consequently, Tesla&#39;s 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk&#39;s social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.Tesla&#39;s announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.Despite the Boring Company&#39;s involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).His comments have been called &quot;elitist&quot; and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.
Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to &quot;Technoking&quot; while retaining his position as CEO.Tesla began delivery of an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008.With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.
Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the Finals trophy.Jordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rbg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals.
On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA Champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor’s single-game playoff scoring record.A Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history swept the series in three games.Jordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season, and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.Despite Jordan&#39;s success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.The Bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.
The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as &quot;self-driving&quot;, he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer &quot;lives at risk&quot;, with some employees resigning in consequence.


== Other activities ==


=== Musk Foundation ===
Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001, whose stated purpose is to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and &quot;safe artificial intelligence&quot;); and support science and engineering educational efforts.From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to non-profit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk&#39;s OpenAI, which was a non-profit at the time.Since 2002, the foundation has made over 350 donations.Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits.Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal&#39;s non-profit Big Green.In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.
He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline, saying that &quot;Mars has zero human population.We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.&quot;Speaking at The Wall Street Journal&#39;s CEO Council session in 2021, Musk stated that a declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.


=== Politics ===

While often described as libertarian, Musk has called himself &quot;politically moderate&quot; and was a registered independent voter when he lived in California.The New York Times wrote that Musk &quot;expresses views that don&#39;t fit neatly into [the American] binary, left-right political framework&quot;.Historically, Musk has donated to both Democrats and Republicans, many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.Beginning in the late 2010s, Musk&#39;s political contributions have shifted to almost entirely supporting Republicans.Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.
With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career, a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead.Afterwards, the Jazz&#39; John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship, achieving a second three-peat in the decade.Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP, having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.Jordan&#39;s six Finals MVPs is a record.The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history, and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.


==== Second retirement (1999–2001) ====
With Phil Jackson&#39;s contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.
On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.Jordan&#39;s responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards&#39; basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland) but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.Despite his January 1999 claim that he was &quot;99.9% certain&quot; he would never play another NBA game, Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter, Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.
In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.The SEC reacted to Musk&#39;s tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the accusation was disputed by Musk.This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (&quot;too high imo&quot;) violated the agreement.FOIA-released records showed that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding &quot;Tesla&#39;s solar roof production volumes and its stock price&quot;.
The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.The Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2.Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout.When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah&#39;s lead to 86–85.The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman.Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell.
== Post-retirement ==
After his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards. His previous tenure in the Wizards&#39; front office had produced mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard &quot;Rip&quot; Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse, although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002. On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as the team&#39;s president of basketball operations. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring, he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.Jordan kept busy over the next few years. He stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles. Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.
Notably, Tesla generates some of its revenue from its sales of carbon credits granted to the company, by both the European Union Emissions Trading System and the Chinese national carbon trading scheme.Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.Wired magazine speculated that Musk&#39;s opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company, despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.


=== Technology ===
Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.Given the influence of Musk&#39;s tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets, his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.Musk&#39;s social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices.
On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: &quot;I&#39;m back.&quot;The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No.45, his baseball number.Despite his eighteen-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back.He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.Boosted by Jordan&#39;s comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.At the end of Game 1, Orlando&#39;s Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan &quot;didn&#39;t look like the old Michael Jordan&quot;, and said that &quot;No.45 doesn&#39;t explode like No.
That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan&#39;s career.He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot.In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus.In what is known as &quot;The Flu Game&quot;, Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.Jordan and the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg, securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.
The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.Before the next season, Jordan said: &quot;I&#39;m not real happy about the record book scenario last year.It&#39;s very, very frustrating.&quot;During the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority of the team for himself, as well as the role of chairman.In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake of the team to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner of the Hornets, although he is keeping a minority stake, The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.
During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis&#39; Primate Research Center.In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant.The company&#39;s animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty.The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink&#39;s animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths.In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.
=== Neuralink ===

In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines.Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink&#39;s research, although Musk&#39;s being listed as such rankled the Neuralink team&#39;s researchers.At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as &quot;a Fitbit in your skull&quot; that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities.Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims, with MIT Technology Review describing them as &quot;highly speculative&quot; and &quot;neuroscience theater&quot;.
Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg.Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.Three-point field goal was not Jordan&#39;s strength, especially in his early years.Later on in Jordan&#39;s career, he improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a respectable 32% success rate.His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97.
He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.Vox said &quot;the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque&quot;, noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla&#39;s shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation&#39;s assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021.The foundation disbursed $160 million to non-profits that year.


=== Hyperloop ===

In 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain—a vacuum tube train—and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the hyperloop.
==== First three-peat (1991–1993) ====
In the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play.The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs.They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them; this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.The Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents.The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.
Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg, and he won the league&#39;s regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.In the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson&#39;s three Finals MVP awards; he also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.Upon winning the championship, his first since his father&#39;s murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.In the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.
On September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world.In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion.On December 30, 2022, it was reported that Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth due to declining stock values in Tesla, becoming the first person in history to lose such a large sum of money.In January 2023, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for experiencing the &quot;largest loss of personal fortune in history&quot; with regards to his financial losses since November 2021, which Guinness quoted a Forbes estimate of $182 billion.Musk&#39;s personal wealth is managed by his family office called Excession LLC, which was formed in 2016 and run by Jared Birchall.


=== Sources of wealth ===
Around 75% of Musk&#39;s wealth derived from Tesla stock in November 2020, a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022, after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.
== College career ==

As a freshman in coach Dean Smith&#39;s team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986, when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography. In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#39;s basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.


== Professional career ==
=== 23XI Racing ===
On September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season. On October 22, the team&#39;s name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team&#39;s entry would bear No. 23. After the team&#39;s inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023. Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season. The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500. 23XI Racing has won four races, two by Wallace, one by Busch, and one by Reddick.


== Personal life ==
Jordan&#39;s nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played NCAA Division I basketball for the UNC Greensboro Spartans and is a scout for the Charlotte Hornets.Jordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.
However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2.The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank.X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company.In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.).He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008.In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy.In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system.In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.
On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan&#39;s purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.It also made him the league&#39;s only African-American majority owner.In 2023, Johnson said he regretted selling the Charlotte Hornets to Jordan.During the 2011 NBA lockout, The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players&#39; share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47.Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: &quot;If you can&#39;t make a profit, you should sell your team.&quot;Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan &quot;a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon&quot; for wanting &quot;current players to pay for his incompetence&quot;.He cited Jordan&#39;s executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.During the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record.
The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is cited to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.Biographer Ashlee Vance has noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would &quot;make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train&quot; proposal current in California at the time and consider more &quot;creative&quot; ideas.
23 used to&quot;.Jordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won.Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No.23.The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.


==== Second three-peat (1996–1998) ====
Jordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.The Bulls eventually finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.
Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition, as the latter&#39;s money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com&#39;s service.Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company.His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company&#39;s employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal&#39;s largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its &quot;sentimental value&quot;.In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating &quot;X, the everything app&quot;.
In addition, Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington&#39;s coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.


=== Washington Wizards (2001–2003) ===
On September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg), and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention; he would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.After suffering torn cartilage in his right knee, and subsequent knee soreness, the Wizards missed the playoffs, and Jordan&#39;s season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.
=== SpaceX ===

In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space.He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and the group returned to the United States empty-handed.In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs.They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected.He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.With $100 million of his own money, Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company&#39;s CEO and Chief Engineer.SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.
Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts.His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them, and coming from off the bench in 15.He averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.
In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games, by utilizing their &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.The Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg, in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers; despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.
Jordan shot 37%, 35%, 42%, and 37% in all the seasons he shot over 200 three-pointers, and also shot 38.5%, 38.6%, 38.9%, 40.3%, 19.4%, and 30.2% in the playoffs during his championship runs, improving his shooting even after the three-point line reverted to the original line.In 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season.In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard, and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player.He ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan&#39;s defensive contributions than his offensive ones.Doc Rivers declared Jordan &quot;the best superstar defender in the history of the game&quot;.Jordan was known to have strong eyesight.
== Wealth ==


=== Net worth ===
Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002.He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.During this period, Musk&#39;s net worth was often volatile.For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index&#39;s history.In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.
=== xAI ===
On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company has reportedly hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.


=== Leadership style ===
Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a &quot;nano-manager&quot;.The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.Musk does not make formal business plans; instead, he says he prefers to approach engineering problems with an &quot;iterative design methodology&quot; and &quot;tolerance for failures&quot;.He has forced employees to adopt the company&#39;s own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors&#39; recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot.His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house.
The Bulls finished the season 38–44, and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.An often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985, when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.The moment was filmed and is often referred to worldwide as an important milestone in Jordan&#39;s rise.The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 and sold for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.Jordan&#39;s 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan&#39;s injury and a 30–52 record, at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return.
On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan&#39;s home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.Jordan&#39;s final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.At several points, he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.


==== Final retirement (2003) ====
With the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan&#39;s final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA.In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.The Miami Heat retired the No.23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.
On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special &quot;Love of the Game Clause&quot; written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.Jordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate.His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts.According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.
In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million.After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine, Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.


=== Tesla ===

Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.Both men played active roles in the company&#39;s early development prior to Musk&#39;s involvement.Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla&#39;s board of directors as chairman.Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.
=== Zip2 ===

In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding. The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto, with Musk coding the website every night. Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch; however, Musk&#39;s attempts to become CEO were thwarted. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.


=== X.com and PayPal ===

Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.
=== Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets ===
On June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team&#39;s second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson.As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.Despite Jordan&#39;s previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte&#39;s marketing campaigns.A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte&#39;s original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.In February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team.On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.
Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla&#39;s valuation and revenue.The deal stipulated that Musk only receives the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market values.It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.Musk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.He claimed his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.Musk has repeatedly described himself as &quot;cash poor&quot;, and has &quot;professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth&quot;.In May 2020, he pledged to sell almost all physical possessions.Musk has defended his wealth by saying he is accumulating resources for humanity&#39;s outward expansion to space.
The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition.The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received &quot;verbal government approval&quot; to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from the Boring Company website in 2021.
==== Pistons roadblock (1987–1990) ====
Jordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting, and he won his first league MVP Award.He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg), and led the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.The Bulls finished 50–32, and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan&#39;s career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the &quot;Bad Boys&quot;.In the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg.
=== OpenAI ===

In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. A particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations. Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI. In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, &quot;only $15 million&quot; of OpenAI&#39;s funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the latter company increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot. Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text), and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).
Jordan&#39;s effective field goal percentage was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Chicago Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.Unlike NBA players often compared to Jordan, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, as he did not need to rely on the three-pointer in order to be effective on offense.Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century, with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots.Jordan&#39;s three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.
=== The Boring Company ===

In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities. Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep &quot;test trench&quot; on the premises of SpaceX&#39;s offices, as that required no permits. The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled. However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021. Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system. In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
=== Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998) ===


==== Early NBA years (1984–1987) ====
The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers).One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.Citing Bowie&#39;s injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers&#39; choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points.In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.

=== Endorsements ===
Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history.He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald&#39;s, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.
James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army&#39;s XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football.He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level.His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney&#39;s junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.

Branson has also talked openly about having ADHD.Branson&#39;s parents were supportive of his endeavours from an early age.His mother was an entrepreneur; one of her most successful ventures was building and selling wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins.In London, he started off squatting from 1967 to 1968.Branson is an atheist.He said in a 2011 interview with CNN&#39;s Piers Morgan that he believes in evolution and the importance of humanitarian efforts but not in the existence of God.&quot;I would love to believe,&quot; he said.&quot;It&#39;s very comforting to believe&quot;.


== Early business career ==
After failed attempts to grow and sell both Christmas trees and budgerigars, Branson launched a magazine named Student in 1966 with Nik Powell.The first issue of Student appeared in January 1968, and a year later, Branson&#39;s net worth was estimated at £50,000.The office for the venture was situated in the crypt of St. John&#39;s Church, off Bayswater Road, in London.Though not initially as successful as he hoped, the magazine later became a vital component of the mail-order record business Branson started from the same church he used for Student.
In March 2000, Branson was knighted at Buckingham Palace for &quot;services to entrepreneurship&quot;.For his work in retail, music and transport (with interests in land, air, sea and space travel), his taste for adventure and for his humanitarian work, he has become a prominent global figure.In 2007, he was placed in the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World list.In June 2023, Forbes listed Branson&#39;s estimated net worth at US$3 billion.On 11 July 2021, Branson travelled as a passenger onboard Virgin Galactic Unity 22 at the edge of space, a suborbital test flight for his spaceflight company Virgin Galactic.The mission lasted approximately one hour, reaching a peak altitude of 53.5 miles (86.1 km).At 70, Branson became the third oldest person to fly to space.


== Early life ==
Richard Charles Nicholas Branson was born on 18 July 1950 in Blackheath, London, the son of Edward James Branson (1918–2011), a barrister, and his wife Evette Huntley Branson (née Flindt; 1924–2021), a former ballet dancer and air hostess.
