<p>In this guide, we fine-tune a ReAct Agent powered by gpt-3.5-turbo to perform better chain-of-thought prompting over financial statements.</p>
<p>We do this in the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Setup LlamaIndex query engine tools over Uber 10Q filings.</p></li>
<li><p>Use our dataset generator to generate a training/evaluation question dataset over a sample 10Q filing. Add complex variations to each question to account for multiple quarters (these complex questions help to induce chain-of-thought prompting).</p></li>
<li><p>Feed these questions through a GPT-4 ReAct Agent. Log inputs/outputs as a dataset to fine-tune over.</p></li>
<li><p>Call OpenAI fine-tuning endpoints to fine-tune gpt-3.5-turbo on this dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Run qualitative evaluation: show that the fine-tuned model performs better in chain-of-thought prompting than the base model.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="note">
<h2>Note<a class="headerlink" href="#note" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Each execution of an agent can involve multiple LLM calls through the ReAct chain-of-thought loop. The prompt inputs/output pair for each LLM call is logged as an individual datapoint in the training dataset, in the chat message format.</p>
<p>A big TODO here is to add more quantitative metrics for better evaluation.</p>

<div class="section" id="setup-data-build-query-engine-tools">
<h2>Setup Data + Build Query Engine Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#setup-data-build-query-engine-tools" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In this section, we load in 3 Uber 10Q fiings (March, June, September). We also setup a standard vector index over each document. This gives the agent the tools to do vector search within any given document.</p>

<h2>Use GPT-4 to Log Input/Output Pairs<a class="headerlink" href="#use-gpt-4-to-log-input-output-pairs" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We run the train questions through a GPT-4 powered ReAct agent to collect prompt outputs.</p>
<p>Every prompt call to the LLM is logged as an input/output pair. Since the ReAct loop can call the LLM multiple times, this means that multiple input/output pairs may be logged per user query.</p>
<p>Our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OpenAIFineTuningHandler</span></code> automatically collects prompt input/outputs when agent queries are run. This dataset can then be saved, in a dataset format <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.jsonl</span></code> that you can directly feed to the OpenAI Finetuning endpoints.</p>

The company relies on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and driver earnings, which have been modified over time and may continue to be modified in the future. Uber faces competition from well-capitalized competitors and may need to maintain or lower fares, service fees, and driver incentives to remain competitive. The company has incurred significant losses since inception and expects operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future. Achieving profitability in many of its largest markets, including the United States, is not guaranteed. Uber also faces regulatory obstacles and legal risks that could adversely impact its business and future prospects.

[45] Agent Response: Uber&#39;s primary business model and the types of services it offers on its platform have remained consistent from March 2022 to September 2022. The company continues to rely heavily on third-party service providers for various aspects of its operations. These include hosting a significant portion of its platform, providing software for its products and offerings, processing payments, and distributing its platform. Any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of Uber&#39;s products and offerings and harm its business. There is no indication of a significant evolution or change in the types of services offered by Uber during this period.

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Cyan">Observation: Uber operates a business model that includes various services. These services include ride-hailing through their Mobility offering, food delivery through their Delivery offering, and freight transportation through their Freight offering. In addition, Uber has licensed its brand to other companies for use in certain regions, such as Didi in China, Yandex.Taxi in Russia/CIS, and Zomato in India. However, it is important to note that while Uber has certain contractual protections in place with these companies, it does not control their actions. Overall, Uber&#39;s business model encompasses a range of services aimed at providing transportation and delivery solutions to customers.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Cyan">Observation: The success of our business relies on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in these infrastructures, such as Internet outages or GPS signal failures, can impact the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable or slow, users may not return to our platform and may choose to use our competitors&#39; products or offerings instead. Additionally, we have no control over the costs of services provided by national telecommunications operators, and if fees increase, consumer traffic may decrease, resulting in a significant decrease in revenue. Our business also depends on the efficient operation of mobile communications systems, and any unanticipated problems like power outages or security breaches could cause delays or interruptions to our products and offerings. Furthermore, foreign governments may shut down our platform, which could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations. We rely on third parties to distribute our platform and provide software for our products and offerings, and any interference from these third parties could adversely affect our business. Our platform also depends on interoperability with various devices, operating systems, and third-party applications, and the loss of interoperability could have a negative impact. Additionally, we rely on third parties for payment processing infrastructure, and if these elements become unavailable or unfavorable, our business could be adversely affected.</span>

The company faces competition in each of its offerings, such as personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, and other ridesharing companies. Additionally, Uber is subject to legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits in the jurisdictions where it operates. These legal challenges can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and may result in financial damages or penalties. Uber also faces regulatory obstacles and potential restrictions on its operations, which could adversely affect its revenue and growth.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Cyan">Observation: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on Uber&#39;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. This includes the valuation of its investments and assets. The uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic, as well as the impact of the pandemic on Uber&#39;s operations and the operations of its investees, have led to changes in estimates and judgments related to the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments, as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The value of Uber&#39;s assets, which includes minority ownership positions in various entities, is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, such valuations. Additionally, if these entities experience a material decline in their business, it would adversely affect the value of Uber&#39;s assets and its financial results.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Cyan">Observation: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on Uber&#39;s investment and asset valuation. The economic impact of the pandemic has caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has adversely affected Uber&#39;s stock price and its ability to access capital markets. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic have heightened many of the risks associated with Uber&#39;s investments and assets. The pandemic&#39;s impact on Uber&#39;s business and financial results may also have cascading effects that could further adversely impact its investment and asset valuation. However, the exact extent of the impact and any permanent changes to Uber&#39;s investments and asset valuation cannot be predicted with certainty.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Cyan">Observation: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on Uber&#39;s business and operations, including reducing the demand for its Mobility offerings globally. As a result, Uber has had to take significant actions in response, such as additional reductions in workforce and changes to pricing models. The pandemic has also affected Uber&#39;s near-term financial results and may continue to impact its long-term financial results. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic makes it difficult to predict its cumulative and ultimate impact on Uber&#39;s future business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic have caused volatility in financial markets, which may adversely impact Uber&#39;s stock price and its ability to access capital markets.

The uncertainty caused by the pandemic has made it difficult to predict the ultimate impact on business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent of the impact will depend on various factors such as the duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness of vaccines, the impact on capital and financial markets, and changes in consumer behavior.

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Cyan">Observation: The financial assets mentioned in the context include non-marketable equity securities, marketable equity securities, and a note receivable from a related party. These assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized into three levels of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 1 assets are valued based on quoted market prices, Level 2 assets are valued using readily available pricing sources or models with market observable inputs, and Level 3 assets are valued based on unobservable inputs and estimation techniques. The Level 3 assets primarily consist of non-marketable equity securities and the note receivable from a related party. The fair value of these assets is estimated using various valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach and option-pricing models. The fair value of these assets can be influenced by factors such as financing transactions, short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility.</span>

<p><strong>Observations</strong>: The finetuned model does much better than the base model in terms of reasoning about the current sequence of steps. It passes more detailed answers to the downstream tools and is more capable of refining its approach when initial queries don’t work. This applies even if the answer isn’t actually found within the context (which is a function of our automatic dataset generation capabilities).</p>
